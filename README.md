### _independent back-end project and open source for everyone_

# **design agency back-end project with detailed documentation**

##### Front-end link : https://github.com/tahmid0111/Design-Agency-Front-End

### _technologies:_

**1. Express** 
**2. React** 
**3. MongoDB** 
**4. mongodb aggregation** 

This is a full fledged back-end project that anyone can clone in his local machine and create a custom front-end project with any library like react, angular, vue or use in a mobile application.

I used mongoose ORM and mongoDB aggregation for Query Writting and it takes this project in advance level of query writting.

I made this project in a well structure that anyone can read the codes very easily and understand the code. I have added comments in every step.

You can see my front-end project for these apis in (  https://github.com/tahmid0111/Design-Agency-Front-End ) this repository.
##### If you plan for making a custom front-end or mobile application then you can use the Documentation link on the top.
